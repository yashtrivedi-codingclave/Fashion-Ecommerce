# CLI release line the stock dashboard and seller-panel templates are
# extracted from (only used when the build context has no apps/dashboard or
# apps/seller-dashboard). Caret-pinned so template fixes in CLI minors/patches
# reach image rebuilds automatically while a future CLI major (which may
# reshape the template layout) requires a deliberate bump here.
#
# The floor matters: templates/seller-dashboard-starter first ships in the
# 3.0 line (which also drops the legacy Rails admin), so an older CLI has no
# stock seller panel to bake and the seller stage fails rather than silently
# producing an empty bundle.

# Layout normalization — the same Dockerfile builds from either context shape,
# detected from the files actually present (no build args, no named contexts,
# so it behaves identically under plain `docker build`, Render, Railway, and
# `spree build --production`):
#
#   create-spree-app project:
#     context = repo root; Rails app in server/ (backend/ in projects
#     scaffolded before the rename), React Dashboard in apps/dashboard/.
#
#   standalone:
#     context = Rails app root, no server/, backend/ or apps/.
#
# server/Gemfile (or backend/Gemfile) marks the project layout; apps/dashboard/ and
# apps/seller-dashboard/ mark customized apps (without them, the stock
# templates bundled with @spree/cli are baked).
